# Sent Emails (Testing Mode)

This folder contains emails that were sent in **File Fallback Mode**.

## What is this?

When the email system is in testing mode (`use_file_fallback = true`), all emails are saved as HTML files here instead of being sent via email. This allows you to:

- Test email templates without sending real emails
- Preview how emails will look to recipients
- Debug email content and formatting
- Work without configuring an SMTP server

## How to View Emails

1. Navigate to this folder: `/admin/sent_emails/`
2. Open any `.html` file in a web browser
3. The email will display exactly as recipients would see it

## File Naming

Files are named: `email_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_[hash].html`
- Date and time of sending
- Unique hash to prevent overwrites

## Email Metadata

Each HTML file contains metadata at the top:
```
<!--
To: recipient@email.com
Subject: Email Subject
Date: 2025-12-15 10:30:45
-->
```

## Switching to Production Mode

When ready to send real emails:

1. **Option A: Use SMTP (Recommended)**
   - Install PHPMailer: `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`
   - Edit `/config/email.php`
   - Configure SMTP settings (Gmail/Outlook/Custom)
   - Set `use_file_fallback = false`

2. **Option B: Use PHP mail()**
   - Install sendmail: `sudo apt-get install sendmail`
   - Edit `/config/email.php`
   - Set `use_file_fallback = false`
   - Set `smtp_enabled = false`

See `/config/EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## Security Note

**Do not commit this folder to Git** - it may contain sensitive recipient information.
